# 3-Partition problem

The 3-partition problem - NP-complete - decide whether a given multiset of integers can be partitioned into triplets that all have the same sum:


Example:

Input:
1, 1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 6, 6, 7, 7, 8, 9, 9, 10, 10, 12, 15, 18, 19, 21

Output:
(1, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18), 61
(4, 7, 10, 19, 21), 61
(1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10), 61
